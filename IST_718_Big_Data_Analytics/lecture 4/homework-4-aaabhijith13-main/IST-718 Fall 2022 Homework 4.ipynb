    "- You are welcome to discuss the problems with your classmates but __you are not allowed to copy any part of your answers from your classmates.  Short code snippets are allowed from the internet.  Code from the class text books or class provided code can be copied in its entirety.__\n",
    "- Google Colab is the official class runtime environment so you should test your code on Colab before submission.\n",
    "- Do not modify cells marked as grading cells or marked as do not modify.\n",
    "- Before submitting your work, remember to check for run time errors with the following procedure:\n",
    "`Runtime `$\\rightarrow$ Factory reset runtime followed by Runtime $\\rightarrow$ Run All.  All runtime errors will result in a minimum penalty of half off.\n",
    "- All plots shall include descriptive title and axis labels.  Plot legends shall be included where possible.  Unless stated otherwise, plots can be made using any Python plotting package.\n",
    "- Grading feedback cells are there for graders to provide feedback to students.  Don't change or remove grading feedback cells.\n",
    "- Don't add or remove files from your git repo.\n",
    "- Do not change file names in your repo.  This also means don't change the title of the ipython notebook.\n",
    "- You are free to add additional code cells around the cells marked `your code here`.\n",
    "- import * is not allowed because it is considered a very bad coding practice and in some cases can result in a significant delay (which slows down the grading process) in loading imports.  For example, the statement `from sympy import *` is not allowed.  You must import the specific packages that you need. \n",
    "- The graders reserve the right to deduct points for subjective things we see with your code.  For example, if we ask you to create a pandas data frame to display values from an investigation and you hard code the values, we will take points off for that.  This is only one of many different things we could find in reviewing your code.  In general, write your code like you are submitting it for a code peer review in industry.  \n",
    "- Level of effort is part of our subjective grading.  For example, in cases where we ask for a more open ended investigation, some students put in significant effort and some students do the minimum possible to meet requirements.  In these cases, we may take points off for students who did not put in much effort as compared to students who put in a lot of effort.  We feel that the students who did a better job deserve a better grade.  We reserve the right to invoke level of effort grading at any time.\n",
    "- Your notebook must run from start to finish without requiring manual input by the graders.  For example, do not mount your personal Google drive in your notebook as this will require graders to perform manual steps.  In short, your notebook should run from start to finish with no runtime errors and no need for graders to perform any manual steps."
