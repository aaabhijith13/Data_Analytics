```
* We can see that there are 40,600 rows of observations and there are 20 variables in total. 
* The 20 Variables are as follows: 
• IsCanceled:	Categorical	Value	indicating	if	the	booking	was	canceled	(1)	or	not	(0)		
• LeadTime:	Integer,	Number	of	days	that	elapsed	between	the	entering	date	of	the	booking	into	and	the	arrival	date

* Looking at the variable ISCancelled we can see that there were 28938 cancellations, and 11122 non-cancellations. 

#Check if any variable has missing value as well as if any variable has a value lower than zero.
```{r}
null_greater_than_0 <- function(data_frame) {
  
  which(is.na(data))
  col <- as.list(colnames(data))
  
  for (i in col) {
    
    if (!(identical(which(is.na(data[,i])), character(0)))) {
      new_var <- sprintf("%s, has no null values.",i)

      cat("\n")
    }
  }
}

null_greater_than_0(data_frame = data)
```
* From the cleaning of the data, we can see that there are no null values in any of the columns. 
* From the data description, we can see that all the columns have be above 0. After the analysis done above, it is seen that none of the columns have any negavtive values, all values > 0. 


#Create a new variable for overall nights each customer stayed in hotel. That is, combine StayInWeekNights and StayInWeekendNight to have a variable representing the number of total nights, regardless of week day or weekend, stayed in hotel. 
```{r}
data$StayInNights <- NA #create an empty column named StayInNights
data$StayInNights <- data$StaysInWeekNights + data$StaysInWeekendNights
```
* Added a new variable StayInNights to track the overall number of days that is spent after the booking. 

#Explore which variables are categorical and which variables are continuous. Then, create a new data frame for both types of independent variable (categorical vs. continuous).
```{r}

numeric <- c("LeadTime", "StaysInWeekendNights", "StaysInWeekNights", "StayInNights", "Adults", "Children", "Babies", "PreviousCancellations", "PreviousBookingsNotCanceled", "BookingChanges", "RequiredCarParkingSpaces", "TotalOfSpecialRequests")

for (i in categorical) {
  data[,i] <- as.factor(data[,i])
}

unique(data$Adults)
```

* The variables have been seperated into Numeric and Categorical, there are 12 numeric variables and 9 categorical variables. 
* The numeric variables are: Leadtime, StayInWeekeendNights, StayinWeekNights, StayInNights, Adults, Children, Babies, PreviousCancellations, PreviousBookingsNotCancelled, BookingChanges, RequiredCarParkignSpaces and TotalOfSPecialRequests
* The categorical variables are: IsCancelled, Meal, Country, MarketSegment, IsRepeatedGuest, ReservedRoomType, AssignedRoomType , DepositType, CustomerType. 
#Review cancellations and noncancellations separately for each variable
```{r}
cancelled <- subset(data, IsCanceled == 1)
not_cancelled <- subset(data, IsCanceled == 0)

summary(cancelled)
summary(not_cancelled)
```

* After the code above, the variables has been seperated into categorical and numerical. 
* Looking at the statistics for the cancelled bookings: 
- On average Lead time was around 128.7 number of days, the data suggests that Lead time is heavily righty skewed. 
- On average both StayinWeekenedNights and StayinWeekNights had on average 1.344 and 3.44 days, and both the variables were rightly skewed. 
- Looking at the adults,children and babies, mean of each of the columns is near 0, with very little data in the upper quartiles. 
- The most common meal was BB(bed and Breakfast) with 7853 meals while the least was SC(Undefined) with 3 meals. 
- The most common county with cancelled bookings is PRT(Portugal) 7438, the least being Germany with 146 cancellations.
- The most common MarketSegment is Online TA  with 6248 while the least common is Complimentary with 33. 
- Booking names are not often not repeated with 11,011
- PreviousBookingNotCancelled and PreviousCancellations both have a mean near 0. 
- Most common reserved room type is A with 6382 
- Most common assignedroomtype is A with 6047 and most common deposit type is no-deposit with 9450, while the most common customer type is 9416. 
- StayinNights which was the combination of StayinWeekendNights and StayinWeekNights have a mean ner 4.776 days, while the maxium is 56, the data is very righly skewed. 
-RequiredCarParkingsSpaces was 0 overall. 

* Looking at the statistics for the not_cancelled bookings: 
- On average Lead time was around 78.8 number of days, the data suggests that Lead time is heavily righty skewed. 
- On average both StayinWeekenedNights and StayinWeekNights had on average 1.3 and 3.9 days, and both the variables were rightly skewed. 
- Looking at the adults,children and babies, mean of each of the columns is near 0, with very little data in the upper quartiles. 
- The most common meal was BB(bed and Breakfast) with 22162 meals while the least was SC(Undefined) with 83 meals. 
- The most common county with cancelled bookings is PRT(Portugal) 10192, the least being Germany with 1057 cancellations.
- The most common MarketSegment is Online TA  with 11418 while the least common is Complimentary with 168. 
- Booking names are not often mean of about 0. 
- PreviousBookingNotCancelled and PreviousCancellations both have a mean near 0. 
- Most common reserved room type is A with 17017
- Most common assignedroomtype is A with 10999 and most common deposit type is no-deposit with 28749, while the most common customer type is transient with 20793. 
- StayinNights which was the combination of StayinWeekendNights and StayinWeekNights have a mean ner 4.113 days, while the maxium is 56, the data is very righly skewed. 
-RequiredCarParkingsSpaces was 0 overall. 

* Looking at both the data sets, it is observed that there are more observations for not_cancelled data set compared to the cancelled data, but the trends accross the two differnet data sets remain the same. Nearly all columns regardless if they were in the cancelled or not_cancelled data set showed very similar patterns. 

#Check the distribution of each continuous variable: Is the data normally distributed? 
```{r}
histogram_boxplot <- function(arg1, x_title) {
  
  list <- as.list(arg1)
  
  p2 <- ggplot(data, aes(x = arg1)) + 
    geom_histogram(color = 'black', fill = 'white', bins =50) +
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(unlist(list))), color="blue", linetype="dashed") +
    ggtitle(cat("Histogram for", x_title)) + xlab(x_title)
  
  p1 <- ggplot(data, aes(y = arg1)) + geom_boxplot() + ylab(x_title) +
    geom_hline(yintercept=mean(unlist(list)), linetype="dashed", color = "blue") +  
    coord_flip() + grid.newpage()
  
  return(grid.draw(rbind(ggplotGrob(p1), ggplotGrob(p2), size = "last")))
  
} #get the two graphs on the same x-axis line 

for (i in numeric) {
  
  print(histogram_boxplot(continuousVars[,i], i))

}
```
* Looking at Leadtime, it looks very righly skewed with lots of outliers visible after the 3rd quartile. 
* StayinWeekendNights, StayinNIghts and StayInNights all look to slighly righly skewed, with many data points hitting very few numbers. Most of the frequency of the numbers are right about the mean. Outliers are also visible with all these columns. 
* For ADults, Children, Babies, PreviousCancellations, PreviousBookingsNotCanceled, BookingChanges, RequiredCarParkingSpaces, 
all have means centered around 0. However, all these graphs look to have outliers. 
* For totalOfSpecial Requests, it looks like the mean is centered between 0 and 1, while there are most of the special requests seem to be around 0, followed by 1 2 and 3. 
* Overall, looking at the variables, most of the variables have means centered around 0, with very frequency of data. Also, alot of the variables seem to have outliers. To understand the variables better and to visualize them better, transformation of the data need to be done. For this we have chosen, sqrt transformation as most of the variables have data that includes 0. Otherwises a log transformation would be more appropirate, seeing how skewed the data is. 

#Transform the necessary data that are not normally distributed. Then, again check for the distributions via histograms.
```{r}
library(moments)

#add to the list
#to_be_transformed 
print(numeric[3])
numeric
continuousVars
for (i in numeric){
  continuousVars[,i] <- sqrt(continuousVars[,i])
}
# < 0 skewed left (left tail)
# > 0 skewed right (right tail)
# = 0 normal

for (i in numeric){
  print(histogram_boxplot(continuousVars[,i], i))
  print(skewness(continuousVars[,i]))
}

```
* After the transformations we can see that the LeadTime looks more normally distributed compared to normal. 
* StayInWEekened Nights and StayInNights and StayinWeekdayNights all seem to be more normally distributed. 
* For Adults, Children, Babies, PreviousCancellations, PreviousBookingsNotCanceled, BookingChanges, RequiredCarParkingSpaces, the graphs hasn't changed much as the most of the data was already centerd around 0. 


#Bivariate analysis: Correlation between each continuous variable with another continuous variable. 
```{r}

correlation <- round(cor(continuousVars[, numeric]),2)
correlation

library(reshape2)

melted_cormat <- melt(correlation)
head(melted_cormat)


ggplot(data = melted_cormat, aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill=value)) + 
  geom_tile() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))

```
* LeadTime has good correlation wiwth StayinNights with 0.51
* StayInWeekendNights has good correlation with StayInNights and StayinWeekNights as obviously these vaariables are related, so it makes sense that there is good correlation among these variables. 
* Looking at the heatmap, the correlation between StayinWeekendNights and StayInNights and StayInWeekNights all look highly correlated, other than that no other variable shows significant correlation. 

#Create boxplots for continuous variables to see if there is any difference in the data between cancellations and non-cancellations. 
```{r}
library(gapminder)

for (i in numeric) {
  print(ggplot(continuousVars, (aes(x = IsCanceled, y = continuousVars[,i]))) +
          geom_boxplot(fill=c("deepskyblue", "firebrick2")) + 
          ylab(i) + 
          stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "errorbar", 
                       aes(ymax = ..y.., ymin = ..y..),
                       width = .75, linetype = "dashed"))
  }

#Notes: LeadTime, StayInWeekNights, StayInNights seem interesting.

```
* Leadtime on average is higher among the cancelled bookings. 
* StayInWeekendNights, StayinWeekNights and StayInNights is slightly higher for cancelled bookings. 
* For Adults, Children, Babies, PreviousCancellations, PreviousBookingsNotCanceled, BookingChanges, RequiredCarParkingSpaces, much analysis can't be said between the differences among cancellations and non-cancellations, as there are very few data points and most of the data points are distributed to very few numbers. However, a lot of outliers are visible, so maybe it would be good to do some kind of outlier detection. Or it would be maybe better to change these variables into categorical variables, as most of the distribution of the daata is allocated to very few points. 
* For TotalofSepcial Requests, it seems on average it is higher for non-cancelled bookings. 

#Create bar graphs for categorical variables to check if there is any difference in number of cancellations and non-cancellations for different levels of each categorical variable.
```{r}

print(categorical[-1])
for (i in categorical[-1]) {
  print(ggplot(categoricalVars, (aes(x = categoricalVars[,i], fill=IsCanceled))) +
          geom_bar(position=position_dodge()) + 
          xlab(i) + ylab("Frequency") +
          scale_fill_manual(values=c("deepskyblue", "firebrick2"))
        )
  }


#Create bar plots with percentages to be able to see the pattern better.
for (i in categorical) {
  
  #Find percentages for each level
  var <- categoricalVars %>% group_by(categoricalVars[,i], IsCanceled) %>% 
    summarize(count=n()) %>% 
    mutate(percentage=count/sum(count)*100)
  
  #Plot it
  print(ggplot(var, aes(x=`categoricalVars[, i]`, y=percentage, fill=IsCanceled)) +
          geom_bar(stat="identity",position=position_dodge()) +
          xlab(i) + ylab("Relative Frequency") +
          ylim(c(0,100)) +
          scale_fill_manual(values=c("deepskyblue", "firebrick2"))
    )
}

#Note: Market Segment: Online TA and Groups have more cancellations compared to the other groups.

#Meal: FB-Full Board (breakfast, lunch, dinner) seems to have higher cancellations but the frequency of it is so small. 
categoricalVars %>% group_by(Meal) %>% summarize(count=n()) #There are only 754 FB.

#Deposit Type: Although non-refundable hotel reservations seem to have more cancellations but again the total number of data points for that category is so small.
categoricalVars %>% group_by(DepositType) %>% summarize(count=n()) #1719 non-refundable deposit

#IsRepeatedGuess: Being a repeated guess might mean less cancellations but I don't believe we have enough data for comparison. 
categoricalVars %>% group_by(IsRepeatedGuest) %>% summarize(count=n()) #1778 repeated guests vs. 38,282 non-repeaetd guests.

```
* For the meals, BB is highest among both cancelled and not-cancelled bookings, the least common type of booking is SC, with very minimal bookings. 
* For countries, as mentioned before, the moston common countries where both Cancellations and non-cancellations occured was in Portugal, Great Britain, Spain and Germany. 
* Looking at the Market Segment Most common type of Market Segment for both cancelled and non-cancelled bookings where the Online TA groups, followed ny Offline TA and Direct. 
* For both the non-cancelled and cancelled bookings, Repeated Guests weren't that common. 
* For the reserved room and Assigned Room type, A was the most common reserved room type irrespective of cancellation terms. 
* No Deposit type was the most-common deposit type among both cancelled and non-cancelled bookings. 
* Transient customer type was the most common among Customer Type variables, while the least common Customer type was contract, irrespective of booking type.
